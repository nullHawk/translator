Workspace: Collecting workspace information# English to Hindi Neural Machine Translator

This project implements a neural machine translation system for translating English text to Hindi using a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with attention mechanism. The model is built with PyTorch and features a GRU-based encoder-decoder network.

## Features

- Seq2Seq architecture with attention mechanism
- GRU-based encoder and decoder
- Customizable model parameters (hidden size, embedding dimensions, etc.)
- Interactive translation through command line interface
- Web interface using Gradio
- Support for vocabulary management and data preprocessing
- Teacher forcing during training

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/english-hindi-translator.git
cd english-hindi-translator
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirment.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the translation model:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the Hindi-English parallel corpus
- Build vocabularies for both languages
- Initialize and train the Seq2Seq model
- Save model checkpoints after each epoch

### Translation via Command Line

For interactive translation through command line:

```bash
python inference.py
```

### Web Interface

To launch the web interface for translation:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start a Gradio interface that you can access in your web browser.

## Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: GRU-based with configurable layers and embedding dimensions
- **Decoder**: GRU with attention mechanism
- **Attention**: Calculates attention scores between encoder outputs and decoder hidden states
- **Training**: Uses teacher forcing and cross-entropy loss
